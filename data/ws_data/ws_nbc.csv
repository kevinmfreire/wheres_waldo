The Austin American-Statesman said the timeline was based on documents it reviewed following the May 24 attack in Uvalde that killed 19 children and two teachers. The Texas Tribune on Monday night also reported the new details, citing records and surveillance video it had reviewed. NBC News has not seen or reviewed the documents. But the reports could raise further questions about the long delay before officers breached the classroom doors and killed the 18-year-old gunman. It was around 80 minutes from when the gunman entered the school around 11:33 a.m. and when police entered the classroom around 12:50 p.m. and killed him, according to official accounts. According to the Statesman, a reconstructed timeline shows officers were inside the school three minutes after the gunman entered. Pete Arredondo, police chief for the school district, at 11:40 a.m. called Uvalde police for help and said, “We have him in the room. He’s got an AR-15. He’s shot a lot,” according to the Statesman.  Arredondo said also said “They need to be outside the building prepared because we don’t have firepower right now” and “it’s all pistols,” according to the newspaper.  A lawyer for Arredondo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports Monday night. Law enforcement officers were seen on security camera with rifles and a ballistic shield in a hallway at 11:52 a.m., according to the report. “If there’s kids in there, we need to go in there,” one officer is reported to have said.  Another responded, “Whoever is in charge will determine that,"" it said. The Texas Tribune reported that in the records and materials it reviewed, no security footage from inside the school showed police officers attempting to open the doors to classrooms 111 and 112. Authorities have said that officers eventually entered the classroom using keys provided by a janitor. The Tribune reported that based on what it reviewed, one officer said minutes into the response that a Halligan bar, which is a firefighting tool, was on site but it wasn’t brought into the school for an hour, and that authorities waited for keys instead. The police account of the massacre changed in the days after the rampage, sparking anger. Gov. Greg Abbott said he had been “misled.” The U.S. Justice Department on May 29 announced that it will review the law enforcement response. Experts have said that will most likely focus on the delay in confronting the gunman. The new information is expected to be presented Tuesday to a Texas Senate hearing, according to the Statesman."

The comedy star praised the Ukrainian president — himself a former comedian and actor — as a hero during the meeting, telling him: “You’re amazing.” Stiller visited Zelenskyy in his role as an ambassador for the United Nations refugee agency. It comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to force millions of people to flee the war-torn country, exacerbating a growing global crisis that has seen the number of displaced people pass 100 million for the first time on record. ""It's a great honor for me,"" Stiller, who was appointed a UNHCR goodwill ambassador in July 2018, said in video capturing the meeting. ""It's really wonderful, you're my hero. You're amazing,"" he said.  ""We know you very well,"" Zelenskyy said of the ""Zoolander"" star.  The pair found common ground in their shared roots in the entertainment industry, with Zelenskyy having previously played a Ukrainian president in a popular television show before his real-life landslide election victory in 2019. “You quit a great acting career for this,” Stiller told Zelenskyy, praising the president for his leadership in the war.  “Not so great as you,” the Ukrainian leader quipped. ""No, but pretty great,"" Stiller responded. ""But what you've done and the way that you've rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring,"" he said. Sitting down with Stiller, the Ukrainian leader said that while it might not be ""interesting to speak about the war each, you know, every day,"" he said that ""for us, it's very important.""  Putting pressure on Moscow to end the war, which was launched nearly four months ago now, is ""very difficult"" when ""people forget to speak about it,"" Zelenskyy said, before thanking Stiller for bringing fresh attention to the conflict. Moved by what he saw during his trip to Ukraine, Stiller said: ""I think it's hard to understand what's actually going on here if you haven't been here.""  ""Just the actual impact of coming here,"" he said. ""The level of destruction ... You see it on TV, you see it on social media. It's something else to actually see it and feel it."" Stiller was joined by UNHCR Representative in Ukraine Karolina Lindholm Billing. They visited Zelenskyy's office after seeing the region around Kyiv, including ruined residential areas of Irpin, where they spoke with people who survived occupation by Russian forces, a news release from Zelenskyy's office said. The actor also met with the new U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, who said in a tweet that Stiller's visit had brought ""much-needed attention to humanitarian needs during the largest and fastest humanitarian crisis in recent memory."" A number of politicians and celebrities from around the world have visited Ukraine in the midst of Russia's invasion, with actor Angelina Jolie visiting Lviv in April to meet with children affected by the war. More than 12 million people have fled their homes since Russia launched its invasion, according to the United Nations. More than 5 million have sought refuge in countries across Europe, while more than 7 million are believed to have been displaced within the country. "
2,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/elon-musks-child-seeks-name-change-reflect-gender-identity-sever-ties-rcna34479,"Elon Musk’s transgender daughter has filed a request to change her name in accordance with her gender identity and because “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.” The petition for both a name change and a new birth certificate reflecting her gender identity was filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Monica in April. It came to light recently in some online media reports. Musk's daughter, who recently turned 18, the age of consent in California, has asked the court to change her gender recognition from male to female and to register her new name, according to court documents available online through PlainSite.org. Her new name was redacted in the online document. Her mother is Justine Wilson, who divorced Musk in 2008. There was no further explanation of the rift between Musk’s daughter and her father, the Tesla and SpaceX chief who is attempting a $44 billion takeover of social media platform Twitter. Neither a lawyer who represents Musk nor the Tesla media office immediately responded to emails requesting comment on Monday.  In May, about a month after the name and gender change document was filed, Musk declared his support for the Republican Party, whose elected representatives support a raft of legislation that would limit transgender rights in states across the country. Musk has weighed in on the issue of transgender people choosing their preferred pronouns, tweeting in 2020, “I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare.”"

Currently, Dartmouth undergraduates from families with an annual income of $125,000 or less who possess typical assets are offered need-based aid without a required loan component. Dartmouth is now removing the loan requirement for undergraduates from families with annual income of more than $125,000 who receive need-based financial aid. This will decrease the debt burden for hundreds of middle-income Dartmouth students and their families by an average of $22,000 over four years, the school said in a news release Monday. A fundraising effort that began in 2018 called The Call to Lead has deepened Dartmouth’s commitment to make a college education accessible and affordable for the most promising and talented students from around the world and from all economic backgrounds, President Philip Hanlon said. More than 65 families supported the campaign goal to eliminate loan requirements from Dartmouth’s undergraduate financial aid awards, committing more than $80 million in gifts to the endowment. Dartmouth is joining Ivy League peers Brown University, Columbia University, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University in adopting no-loan policies, The Dartmouth newspaper reported."
4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dave-chappelle-decides-letting-high-school-theater-named-rcna34483,"Dave Chappelle has revealed that he’s decided against having the theater at his former high school named after him after plans for him to become the venue’s eponym were originally put in place. The standup comedian made his opinion on the matter public Monday night while he was visiting Washington, D.C. for a dedication ceremony of the venue at Duke Ellington School of the Arts, his alma mater. The Washington Post first reported the story. While Chappelle reaffirmed that he believed criticisms against him weren’t productive, he also stated that he didn’t want his name to be on the theater if that would distract students. Instead of the student theater bearing his name, the space will instead be called the Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression. Representatives for Chappelle could not be immediately reached for comment. The school had initially made plans for a naming ceremony with Chappelle last year, but the dedication was postponed after the comedian became the subject of a wave of controversy from members and allies of the LGBTQ community for using language described as transphobic in his 2021 Netflix special “The Closer.” More specifically, Chappelle also became the subject of criticism from some members of Duke Ellington’s student body in November when he visited the campus. Some students questioned the comedian directly regarding his dismissal of the criticism he’s received from LGBTQ individuals. “I’m 16 and I think you’re childish, you handled it like a child,” one student reportedly told Chappelle at the time. “The Ellington family is my family,” Chappelle affirmed on Monday evening after voicing his decision. Chappelle remains one of Duke Ellington’s most prolific donors and supporters, having given several millions of dollars to the institution, appeared for commencement speeches and hosted masterclasses for students. He had described the initial decision to name the theater after him as “the most significant honor of my life.”"
