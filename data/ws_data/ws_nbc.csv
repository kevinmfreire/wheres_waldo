0,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-committee-will-show-evidence-trumps-involvement-fake-elector-plo-rcna34315,"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol will present evidence in a public hearing this week about then-President Donald Trump’s involvement in a failed scheme to push slates of bogus electors to overturn the 2020 election results, Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the panel, said Sunday. “We’ll show evidence of the president’s involvement in this scheme,” Schiff, D-Calif., said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We’ll also again show evidence about what his own lawyers came to think about this scheme. And we’ll show courageous state officials who stood up and said they wouldn’t go along with this plan to either call legislators back into session or decertify the results for Joe Biden.” The system held, he said, because numerous state and local election officials, Republicans and Democrats alike, “upheld their oath to the Constitution.” After the election, certificates purporting to be from Trump electors were sent to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., by Republicans in seven battleground states that Joe Biden won — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The efforts, which were ultimately unsuccessful, created two sets of electors: an official group selected by the states and the fake ones. Asked whether the committee has evidence that Trump “directed” the scheme, Schiff said, “We don’t want to get ahead of our hearing."" “We’ll show during the hearing what the president’s role was in trying to get states to name alternate slates of electors, how that scheme depended, initially, on hopes that the legislatures would reconvene and bless it,” Schiff said. “They didn’t, and they pressed forward with it anyway.” The Justice Department said this year that federal prosecutors were looking into the legal ramifications for those involved in the scheme to push slates of fake Electoral College members declaring Trump the winner of states that Biden won.

1,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/may-utah-fire-reignites-spreads-rapidly-heat-wind-lightning-rcna34334,"Amid the many ongoing, long-term blazes in the West, one stands out as a zombie thriving on heat, oxygen and fuel: Utah's Left Fork Fire. It started May 9 when a prescribed burn got out of control and grew to an estimated 100 acres, officials said. It died down, was mopped up, then reignited and smoldered through June, said Karl Hunt, spokesperson for the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire & State Lands. Late Saturday it came to life a third time, he said, and grew to an estimated 700 acres. The area north of the state's border with Arizona, which has had fire problems of its own, was hit with thunderstorms, including lightning, but the cause of the blaze's second restart was under investigation. ""We’ve had very high winds in this area,"" Hunt said. With the summer solstice just two days away, the hottest season is looking as bad for wildfires as officials had predicted. The National Interagency Coordination Center said Sunday that there were four new large fires among 32 active fires, most in Alaska and the West. Major wildfires burning Sunday included the nearly 18,000-acre Contreras Fire, 20 miles east of Sells, Arizona, which had no containment, and the more than 26,000-acre Pipeline Fire, 6 miles north of Flagstaff, Arizona, with 27 percent containment. On Thursday, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey issued a declaration of emergency that unleashes new funding for the battle against the Pipeline Fire. ""Windy, hot, and dry weather conditions in the area have made fire suppression efforts incredibly difficult,"" he said in a statement. The Left Fork Fire is but a speck among them, yet its resilience may bode ill for a nation under multiple red flag warnings and facing historic heat before the meteorological summer. The National Weather Service on Sunday said a high pressure system north of the lower 48's geographical center is creating ""dangerous heat"" from the Midwest to the Deep South, with some parts of the the nation seeing temperatures 20 degrees and more above average for this time of year. Seasonal heat in the Southwest was punctuated by the kind of monsoonal moisture more typical of late summer. Showers and even flooding was possible in eastern Arizona, southern Colorado, and much of New Mexico, federal forecasters said. Of the large, active wildfires in the United States Sunday, only four were contained, the National Interagency Coordination Center reports. The acreage consumed so far this year compared with the same time last year has nearly tripled, its data show. David Tebbs, a commissioner in Garfield County, part of the Left Fork Fire's footprint, reported on Facebook that five engines, a smoke jumper crew, and one help crew was assigned to the restarted Left Fork Fire and that another eight crews had been requested. Interagency firefighting crew Lone Peak Hotshots said it was also responding to the blaze. Wind gusts expected to be as strong as 55 mph prevented fire suppression from the air, officials said. Despite the thunderstorm activity in the West, the fire was raging amid humidity in the single digits, according to a Utah Division of Wildlife Resources fact sheet cited by NBC affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City. The fire was burning near Rainbow Point in Dixie National Forest, state officials said. After its May 9 start, it reached a nadir May 13, when it was 60 percent contained and under the purview of mop-up crews.  Overnight, after its restart, the wildfire grew to 325 acres, state officials said.  On Sunday its size was estimated to be double that, and it continued to grow in rough terrain that's hard to reach, state officials said. It cast a cloud of dark smoke over an area of southern Utah."
2,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/colombia-elects-first-leftist-president-first-afro-colombian-female-pr-rcna34336,"BOGOTA/BUCARAMANGA, Colombia — Leftist Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M-19 guerrilla movement who has vowed profound social and economic change, won Colombia’s presidency on Sunday, the first progressive to do so in the country’s history. Petro beat construction magnate Rodolfo Hernandez with an unexpectedly wide margin of some 716,890 votes. The two had been technically tied in polling ahead of the vote. Petro, a former mayor of capital Bogota and current senator, has pledged to fight inequality with free university education, pension reforms and high taxes on unproductive land. He won 50.5% to Hernandez’s 47.3%. Petro’s proposals — especially a ban on new oil projects — have startled some investors, though he has promised to respect current contracts.  Supporter Alejandro Forero, 40, who uses a wheelchair, cried as results rolled in at the Petro campaign celebration in Bogota. ""Finally, thank God. I know he will be a good president and he will help those of us who are least privileged. This is going to change for the better,” said Forero, who is unemployed. This campaign was Petro’s third presidential bid and his victory adds the Andean nation to a list of Latin American countries that have elected progressives in recent years. Petro, 62, said he was tortured by the military when he was detained for his involvement with the guerrillas, and his potential victory has high-ranking armed forces officials bracing for change. Petro’s running mate Francia Marquez, a single mother and former housekeeper, will be the country’s first Afro-Colombian woman vice-president.  “Today I’m voting for my daughter — she turned 15 two weeks ago and asked for just one gift: that I vote for Petro,” said security guard Pedro Vargas, 48, in Bogota’s southwest on Sunday morning. I hope this man fulfills the hopes of my daughter, she has a lot of faith in his promises,” added Vargas, who said he never votes. Petro has also pledged to fully implement a 2016 peace deal with FARC rebels and seek talks with the still-active ELN guerrillas. He had raised doubts about the integrity of the count after irregularities in congressional tallies in March, and earlier on Sunday urged voters to check their ballots for any extraneous marks which could invalidate them.  Hernandez, who served as mayor of Bucaramanga, was a surprise contender in the run-off and has promised to shrink government and to finance social programs by stopping corruption. He has also pledged to provide free narcotics to addicts in an effort to combat drug trafficking. Despite his anti-graft rhetoric, Hernandez is under a corruption investigation himself over allegations he intervened in a trash management tender to benefit a company his son lobbied for. He has denied wrongdoing. Defense Minister Diego Molano told journalists on Sunday afternoon that the killing of an electoral volunteer in Guapi, Cauca province, was under investigation. Sixty voting locations had to be moved because of heavy rains in some parts of the country, the registrar said. Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."
3,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/state-state-patients-are-losing-telehealth-access-doctors-rcna30585,"Many states are making it difficult for people to have virtual visits with doctors in other states, partly reversing the explosion in telehealth that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic and calling into question the durability of one of the major technological shifts from the past two years.  The rollback in telehealth access has been happening gradually and quietly over the past few months as pandemic-era emergency health orders have lapsed in one state after another, reimposing some of the old rules about when doctors can practice in multiple states.  At Johns Hopkins Medicine, some patients and their families now have to switch doctors or drive hours to different states when previously video calls from their homes would have been allowed under the looser regulations, said Dr. Brian Hasselfeld, the health system’s medical director for digital health and telemedicine.  The major barrier is licensing: a requirement rooted in the 19th century that a doctor must have a license from the state where a patient is located, even if the doctor is licensed elsewhere.  “Most states now are back to the pre-pandemic licensure rules, where you must be licensed in our state if you’re going to see patients in our state,” Hasselfeld said.  A year ago, 26 states still had pandemic-era waivers that allowed residents to have virtual visits with doctors who were based in other states, according to the Federation of State Medical Boards, which represents the licensing boards in U.S. states and territories.  Now, only 12 states still have their pandemic-era waivers, according to the federation. California, New Jersey and some of the other remaining states are scheduled to let their emergency waivers expire soon, the federation said. Nineteen more states have some long-term rules for interstate telemedicine, although they vary.  There’s a lot riding on the regulations for patients and doctors, as well as a wave of tech startups that has risen in the past two years hoping to capitalize on the convenience of remote visits.  And there’s renewed urgency among some patients and physicians to make telemedicine work across state lines because of the national debate around abortion and the likelihood that the Supreme Court will overturn the constitutional right to an abortion set out in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. A number of states have passed abortion-related carve-outs to their telemedicine regulations, often requiring doctors and patients to be in the same room for discussions about abortion.  Linda Branagan, the director of telehealth programs at the University of California, San Francisco, said the rapid changes in state laws and regulations are “operationally untenable,” especially when patients are often in such vulnerable positions.  “We have asked patients to come on site who we normally would see by video,” she said. “They’re either financially fragile or clinically fragile or both.”  Before the pandemic, about 2% of UCSF’s outpatient appointments happened over Zoom-style calls, and officials considered that a success, Branagan said. The share soon jumped to 60% of appointments during the height of social distancing, and it has since dropped to 25%, she said, as patients and providers seek a balance and try to comply with state regulations.  The reappearance of such barriers for physicians doesn’t affect in-state video visits or some calls with other medical professionals or nurses, but it’s still a common issue, especially for certain medical specialties or for in-demand doctors who are used to seeing patients from around the country.  “The true value in telehealth lies in being able to see your doctor, not any doctor,” said Dr. Thomas Kim, the chief behavioral health officer for Prism Health North Texas. He said he’s not worried about telehealth falling away, but he said providers need to think of it as a skill, not a service in and of itself.  Nearly 1 in 10 of the telehealth visits at Johns Hopkins are with patients who live in states where the system doesn’t have operations, Hasselfeld said. He said it’s now routine for the staff members who scheduled appointments to double-check where patients will physically be for video calls, which didn’t matter two years ago.  “It’s been really difficult to try to explain that providers can see patients only in specific areas,” Hasselfeld said.  Separate from the issue of medical licensing is who pays for telehealth visits — and whether providers get paid as much as they do for in-person visits. Since March 2020, Medicare has waived many restrictions on remote visits, but the waivers are temporary, and they are scheduled to end after the federal Covid-19 emergency order expires unless Congress intervenes.  Doctors, nurses and other medical professionals have historically been licensed at the state level, not by the federal government, and state medical boards have often tried to block out-of-state physicians from seeing patients in their jurisdictions.  “A lot of it is inertia from the way medicine has been practiced in this country for years and decades, really,” said David Peloquin, a partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray in Boston who represents academic hospital systems.  The cross-state practice of medicine wasn’t an issue before the widespread adoption of the internet made virtual visits possible, Peloquin said, and demand really picked up a decade ago as doctors involved in clinical trials sought geographic flexibility. Then the pandemic accelerated the demand.  But there are proponents of keeping something like a state-by-state patchwork, including state medical boards that run the licensing systems. They cite potential abuses, such as unlawful prescription drug sales or the possible difficulties of a medical board’s investigating a physician in another state.  “We want to achieve greater portability, but also we don’t want a system that compromises patient safety,” said Lisa Robin, the chief advocacy officer of the Federation of State Medical Boards.  In April, the federation put forward a new model policy for states to potentially adopt that would support patients traveling out of state or participating in remote clinical trials. The model policy stopped short, however, of full reciprocity between states.  The changes two years ago were meant to be emergency measures at a time of localized spikes in Covid-19 in states such as New York.  “They thought that there’d be a serious Covid rise in cases in one state and the state next door, for example, could have professionals who could help,” said Krista Drobac, the executive director of the Alliance for Connected Care, a lobbying coalition of large employers and hospital systems, such as Stanford, that favor deregulation.  But it turned out there were lots of reasons someone might want to see a doctor based in another state. It may be because patients have moved or have limited choices in their area, especially in certain fields, such as mental health. They may want to see specialists at highly ranked hospitals or participate in clinical trials based elsewhere.  Or patients may simply be on vacation or traveling out of state and want to speak with their regular doctors — a situation in which medical licensing boards have often frowned on interstate phone or video call appointments.  “Practically, it’s just a pain in the butt to go to a doctor’s office if it’s far away,” said Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School.  Last year, he wrote about a cancer patient who lives in New York who suddenly had to begin driving three-plus hours to Massachusetts after a state waiver lapsed and Boston-based cancer doctors could no longer practice medicine with patients over the state line.  “We can’t get every single one of our docs licensed in New York,” he said.  There are numerous proposals to lower licensing barriers, including moving to a driver’s license-type system, but none has moved forward. And an interstate compact launched in 2017 has attracted relatively few participants.  Mehrotra, who researches telemedicine, said the experience of the pandemic revealed clear patterns in who uses remote visits and why. There was a large uptake in urban areas, he said, because they have better internet access and had less need for telemedicine before the pandemic. And some fields, such as ophthalmology, didn’t translate as well to video chats as others, such as psychiatry.  “You see a lot of telemedicine for anxiety. You don’t see as much for cataracts,” he said. "
4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/just-give-us-answer-family-us-veteran-missing-ukraine-hope-alive-rcna34291,"The family of a Marine veteran who disappeared fighting in Ukraine believe he is alive and being held as a prisoner of war, a spokesperson said.  Grady Kurpasi, 49, has not been heard from since April 23, the spokesperson, Don Turner, said Saturday, adding that the family want answers about what happened to him. When Kurpasi spoke with his family from Ukraine, Turner said, he was “in good spirits” and “felt like he was doing the right thing.” He added that Kurpasi, who did three combat deployments in Iraq, had traveled to Ukraine for “humanitarian” reasons. Kurpasi, he said, was “just trying to help people in any which way possible.”  His family believe “there is a good possibility he is a POW right now,” Turner said, adding that they think he has already been moved from where they think he was working in southern Ukraine.   Although the family say they have not gotten “substantial” updates from the State Department about Kurpasi’s whereabouts, Turner said they have been conducting their own research to try to track Kurpasi down using “open source networking and just digging and calling people and asking questions.”   Asked what he would say to the Russians if they were holding Kurpasi captive, Turner replied: “I think what the family would ask is just give us an answer.” As to a message for Kurpasi himself, Turner said: “We know you are a strong bastard. Keep it up.” NBC News has asked the Ukrainian and the Russian defense ministries for comment.  Kurpasi and two other U.S. citizens have been reported missing in Ukraine in a week.  Andy Huynh, 27, and Alexander Drueke, 39, both from Alabama, were reported missing by their families last week. Huynh’s fiancée, Joy Black, 21, said Thursday that he is a former Marine who left the service in 2018. Drueke’s mom, Lois, said her son served two tours in Iraq, the last as a lead gunner in Baghdad in 2008-09.  Videos of Huynh and Drueke were shown Friday on RT, a Russian state-controlled international television network, confirming their families’ fears that the men had been captured.  The broadcaster said they were being held captive by the Moscow-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.  NBC News has asked the State Department for comment on Kurpasi’s case.  A State Department spokesperson said Friday that U.S. officials were “monitoring the situation closely.” The spokesperson also reiterated President Joe Biden’s earlier call that U.S. citizens “should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict.” The U.S. has insisted that the Russians have an obligation to treat captive Ukrainian soldiers, as well as volunteers from other countries incorporated into the Ukrainian armed forces, as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.  But two British citizens and a Moroccan, whom Russian officials have labeled “mercenaries,” were sentenced to death this month by pro-Moscow separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine."
