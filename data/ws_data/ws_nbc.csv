Their lives in peril, she and 18 other prominent activists targeted by the Taliban were given seats on a flight and airlifted with their families out of Kabul. Their evacuation was arranged with the aid of women’s rights organizations and the State Department. Ten weeks after she escaped to safety in the U.S. as part of the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome, Mashal found herself out of food and money in a Texas apartment, with no access to health care or transportation and separated from three of her children. Mashal, her husband and her children were among the more than 76,000 evacuees who poured into the U.S. after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. Her family’s bumpy first year in the U.S. highlights the cracks in the resettlement system that have left whole families stuck in hotel rooms for months, overwhelmed by the paperwork needed to start their lives in America. “We are struggling with this complicated system,” Mashal said. “There is one caseworker with 60 clients.” For more on this story, watch NBC’s “Nightly News with Lester Holt” tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT. The case worker at her local resettlement agency was swamped by Afghans needing assistance in the Dallas area. Most of the families had fled Afghanistan with only a single small bag, many not speaking English or knowing how to apply for Social Security or Medicaid or register their kids for school. The Biden administration had instructed the departments of State and Health and Human Services to coordinate with 200 local resettlement agencies to help Afghans rebuild their lives here. But the system was so overwhelmed by the sheer number of refugees that the “welcome” many received was less than ideal. Mashal's family was just one of many that slipped through the cracks. Texas was the unexpected endpoint of their harrowing journey from Kabul to America. The family’s first stop was at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, a military base recast as a refugee camp for nearly 13,000 Afghans. For more than a month evacuees stood in long lines for food and clothing, and there was little privacy in the barracks.  Mashal asked that she and her family be resettled in the Washington, D.C., area, like other prominent activists, so she could continue her work on behalf of Afghan women. She said she was told her family of seven — her, her husband and five children — was too large to be resettled there. She said she was told that if she went to Texas, instead, the family could stay together. But she said that when she and her husband were abruptly put on a plane to Dallas, only her two youngest children were allowed to go with them. The three older children, all over 21, had to stay in Wisconsin. Two made it to Dallas in late October, and the third arrived in January. Within 10 days of their having moved into an apartment north of Dallas, the groceries the resettlement agency provided Mashal had run out. “In the camp they say we are working so that when you resettle you have your own apartment, food stamps, Medicaid, Social Security and work permit, but that’s not the case,” she said. Every member of her family, she said, experienced delays in getting social services. Her son had an eye infection but was turned away from two clinics because he didn’t have Medicaid. A caseworker from the resettlement agency had to drive him to the emergency room for treatment. Her husband, who asked not to be named in this article, didn’t get a work permit until February, four months after he arrived in Texas, Mashal said. He had been a member of the professional class in Kabul. In May he started working at a minimum-wage job. Congress had passed an emergency funding bill that included $6.3 billion to help Afghans and resettlement agencies pay for housing and other basic services.  As part of the program, the federal government provided money to resettlement agencies for services for every evacuee, sometimes referred to as “welcome money.” But the welcome money ran out fast for many. Mashal said she soon had trouble buying her family food. It also took until February, six months after her arrival in the U.S., for Mashal to receive the card she needed to buy food via the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the program once known as “food stamps.” But the first time she used it at a grocery store checkout counter, she learned it wouldn’t cover all her groceries. While she was grateful to be in America, she was frustrated by her struggle to care for her family. It was a low moment, she recalled. “Morally, it was stressful and shameful.” After Mashal told the resettlement agency about her family’s lack of food, she said, a caseworker started bringing supplies every 10 to 15 days. A local nongovernment organization, DFW Refugee Outreach Services, also distributed food to Afghan families several times.  Ultimately, Mashal was able to gather her children, arrange for food and health care and find employment. She has a one-year fellowship at the University of Texas at Arlington Women’s and Gender Studies program, which was arranged with the help of the Georgetown Institute of Women, Peace and Security and the Texas International Education Consortium. She is one of 16 Afghan women who have received fellowships through the Georgetown institute. For the first few months of the job, she commuted three hours each way by trains, a bus and an Uber to get to the university. She and her family have since moved to an apartment closer to work. But the son who had an eye infection is still without Medicaid. Her 25-year-old daughter, who studied medicine in Kabul, doesn’t yet have papers that would let her work, even though the application process began back at Fort McCoy. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Mashal’s family or any Afghan’s individual case, citing privacy considerations.  Mashal said she is concerned for Afghan refugees who don’t speak English and who don’t have connections to American NGOs as she does thanks to her years working alongside U.S. organizations to promote equality for women in Afghanistan. “I worry about women and girls here. Many of them are illiterate and don’t understand the transportation system,” she said. “It is so different from Afghanistan. They need support.” Chris George, the executive director of the Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services resettlement agency in Connecticut, said resettlement agencies across the country struggled to do more with less for Afghan evacuees after they were weakened during the Trump administration. “Many of them had closed down. And then, suddenly, we were asked to do something that was really unprecedented, which is to resettle 76,000 people in a matter of three or four months,” George said. “There were too many cases, too many families coming in too short a period of time. We did the best we could. And in some cases, families suffered.” During the chaos of the first months of Afghan resettlement, volunteers, NGOs and military veterans stepped in to help with the absorption of so many people with language and cultural barriers all needing help at the same time. Retired Green Beret Matthew Coburn of Pennsylvania operated as a one-man resettlement agency for weeks as he assisted the evacuation of four Afghan commandos he’d fought alongside over multiple tours in Afghanistan.  But in an example of bureaucratic wire crossing, an able-bodied former Afghan commando whom Coburn helped to evacuate is still waiting for a work permit while the man’s baby son inexplicably received employment authorization in the mail.  “It has been chaotic, overwhelming and disorganized from the get-go,” Coburn said. “Once the resettlement agency got up to speed, it took a lot of the burden off me, but the government’s bureaucracy” — which provides things like employment authorization and Social Security cards — “still hasn’t caught up.” At times tensions have bubbled up between unaffiliated volunteers trying to help Afghans and the refugee resettlement agencies tasked to do so. In Iowa a volunteer group called Des Moines Refugee Support, which wasn’t officially part of the refugee resettlement agency network, started getting calls from desperate Afghan evacuees. The group stepped in to buy food and clothing and provide rides to doctor’s appointments. Volunteers asked local resettlement agencies for evacuees’ information to help fill out medical forms and register children in school. The group said two agencies refused, citing privacy concerns. “There were kids sitting in hotel rooms for months, not registered for school, because they had no permanent address,” said Alison Hoeman, the founder of Des Moines Refugee Support, who said many of evacuees said they struggled to get enough food. One of the Iowa resettlement agencies declined to comment, and the other didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Mashal’s resettlement agency also didn’t respond to a request for comment. Women fleeing the repression of the Taliban, like Mashal, have also gotten specific help from volunteers and NGOs. As the Taliban closed in on Kabul, Mina’s List, an NGO that helps women run for office in places around the world where women are marginalized, realized the U.S. government was focused on evacuating military contractors who had helped U.S. armed forces.  “Just knowing the demographics, we realized those are mostly men,” said Teresa Casale, the executive director of Mina’s List, who helped flag Mashal and other female human rights activists to the U.S. government as being at risk. A majority of Afghan evacuees are male, and the majority of Afghan women who made it to the U.S. are dependents, according to NGOs that work to support the evacuees. “I do believe that the U.S. government’s overall approach did fail Afghan women and Afghan women leaders in particular. Everything from the peace process to the withdrawal to evacuation and resettlement,” Casale said. The next hurdle for Mashal will be to clear the way to live and work here legally once the two-year grace period ends for Afghans who came to the U.S. as humanitarian parolees. She and her family are applying for asylum, but the system is backlogged, and it could take years. “Every day all I think about are the people left behind in Afghanistan,” she said. “I am committed to continue my work fighting for women and human rights. I will never accept the Taliban’s ideology for women and girls and will continue our struggle.”"
1,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/far-right-surges-french-election-macron-presidency-turmoil-rcna34365,"The far right has sent a shock wave through France's political establishment, winning a historic number of seats in Sunday's parliamentary elections with an unexpected surge. Marine Le Pen's National Rally won 89 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, a dramatic increase from its starting point of just eight and one of the most significant recent results for radical right-wing politics in Europe. Until now, voters across the political spectrum had largely held back the far-right challenge, but Le Pen's transformation of her party's image from fringe extremists to a normalized opposition has seemingly taken hold.   The result also leaves President Emmanuel Macron's second term in turmoil after the success of Le Pen and a resurgent left-wing alliance, an outcome that may not be welcomed in Washington as the West navigates Russia's war in Ukraine and its effects. Macron's centrist Together grouping won the most seats with 245 but fell 44 short of an absolute majority, leaving it unable to pass laws without the help of other parties. Macron won re-election as president against Le Pen in April but is now shorn of his legislative authority. ""The rout of the presidential party is total,"" declared anti-capitalist firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who leads the coalition of left-wing parties that won a remarkable 149 seats to become the largest opposition grouping. He added that the public had rejected what he called ""Macronisme."" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the results, which were finalized Monday morning, a “democratic shock.” For once, few would disagree with Le Pen, the far right's divisive figurehead, who called the election a ""seismic event."" ""It is shocking. There was always an expectation somehow the National Rally would not get itself into a position of power — this is an unprecedented situation,"" said Marta Lorimer, an expert in far-right European politics at the London School of Economics. ""This is still a far-right party, let’s not kid ourselves,"" she added. Not since 1986, when the electoral rules were briefly changed, has a far-right party elected members of Parliament on such a scale. Even then, the National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose toxic political legacy and association with Holocaust denial his daughter Marine has worked hard to shed, won just 35 seats. That result outraged many, and it was enough to end a short-lived experiment with proportional representation, whereby parties' vote shares translate more directly into the numbers of seats they win. The current voting system was specifically designed to stop extremists’ gaining power — which it has now failed to achieve.  ""Le Pen hasn’t come out of nowhere — she’s been around for a while — but they’ve never been able to translate that into parliamentary strength,"" said Rainbow Murray, a professor of French politics at Queen Mary University in London. ""There’s been a pretty heavy collapse of the mainstream, and that’s made it more possible for the far right to creep in,"" she added. Although Macron promised to block the rise of the far right, he has presided over its surge.  Some members of his party were criticized ahead of the election for suggesting that a vote for the left-wing alliance was in some cases worse than voting for Le Pen’s radical nationalists — one pollster argued that ultimately the reluctance of left and liberal voters to back each other’s candidates did help the far right gain seats. Five years ago, Macron came to power on a wave of optimism, with a new party — but now the public is turning away from his centrist vision and embracing extremes at both ends of the political spectrum.  Faced with backing the status quo or choosing an alternative, most French voters chose neither and stayed at home: Turnout was just 46%. Those who did vote were seemingly unenthusiastic about by Macron's new government and the fact that a leader long derided for an aloof and distant approach to politics was again accused of going missing at a key moment. ""One of the reasons he tanked so badly was because he didn’t campaign,"" Murray said. ""He went off to Ukraine for a week when he should have been at home campaigning, desperately trying to get his majority,"" she added. The long- and short-term factors driving voters toward political extremes, including the soaring cost of living, are being felt across the world. But the acute political turmoil the election leaves in its wake is entirely French. There is no playbook for what happens next — Macron himself has yet to comment on the results. A deal between Together and the right-wing Republican Party may seem the most likely solution — but experts are cautious because of resentment the center right holds over Macron's perceived land grab of its policies, political space and personnel. ""They hate him. That’s the problem. They are not inclined to now prop him up, and if they fail to do so … if he wants to get any policy passed, he may have to negotiate it painfully on a case-by-case basis, looking to see if the right or left will support him. It may well be that no one supports him,"" Murray said. The result also has effects far beyond France's borders.  Paris has long been a leading force in the European Union alongside Berlin, with Macron taking center stage since the retirement of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Macron has now been weakened just as the bloc and the broader continent grapple with the conflict in Ukraine, a growing energy crisis and the rise of China. ""It’s a disaster,"" Murray said. ""Macron was the heir to Merkel as the de facto leader of Europe, and now he’s presiding over a country with the most anti-Europe Parliament they’ve ever had."" CORRECTION (June 20, 2022, 11:55 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the number of seats Le Pen’s National Rally previously held in the National Assembly. It was eight, not seven. It also misstated the number of seats the party, then known as the National Front, won in 1986. It was 35, not 36. And it misstated the number of seats Mélenchon’s coalition won Sunday. It won 131 seats, not 149."
2,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/yellowstone-reopen-2-weeks-influx-cash-repairs-rcna34421,"The federal government plans to pump $50 million into fast-tracking road repairs in Yellowstone National Park after record-breaking floods. The National Park Service said in a statement Monday that Yellowstone's northern loop — which has been hit with the worst damage — is expected to reopen within two weeks. Yellowstone's southern loop will reopen for day use Wednesday, with plans to allow overnight access starting July 1, it said. The park service expects that visitor access will be restored to about 80% of the park by July 4. The historic national park, situated mostly in Wyoming and partly in Montana and Idaho, flooded this month from a combination of several inches of rain and snowmelt across the Absaroka and Beartooth mountain ranges, according to the National Weather Service. The waters also caused mudslides and left rocks and other debris, making roads impassable. Floodwaters swept away homes, washed away bridges, stranded people in the park and devastated businesses anticipating the summer tourism season. Around 10,000 visitors were moved out of the 2.2 million-acre park, which typically gets more than 4 million visitors per year. The park service has warned that climate change has accelerated the melting of mountain glaciers, ""shifting beyond the historical range of variability"" and affecting all aspects of park management. A recent multiteam climate assessment of the park concluded that higher temperatures are causing precipitation that would normally fall on the mountains as snow instead of as rain and that the decreasing snowpacks will threaten water availability for people living and working in nearby towns. The park service said the emergency funds will be used to restore temporary access to Gardiner and Cooke City, Montana.  Construction crews and materials that were already in the park for a deferred maintenance project to repair Grand Loop Road will be diverted to Old Gardiner Road, a 5-mile gravel road at the north entrance, the agency said.  The park service's current focus on Old Gardiner Road will be to fix it to ensure access in the winter for emergency services, food and supplies, and the agency said it will evaluate restoring limited visitor access at the north entrance in the coming months. It said it is also working with the Federal Highway Administration to restore access to Silver Gate and Cooke City, near the northeast entrance. The northeast entrance road remains impassable between Lamar Valley and Silver Gate."
3,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/medicare-drug-prices-us-billions-generics-buying-mark-cuban-prices-stu-rcna33949,"How can the U.S. government lower the high price of prescription drugs? It may need to look to tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban for answers. Medicare could have saved nearly $4 billion in 2020 by purchasing generic drugs at the same prices offered by Cost Plus Drug Company, Cuban's online pharmacy that launched this year, according to a study published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. Cost Plus Drug offers certain generic drugs, such as the depression drug fluoxetine or blood pressure medication lisinopril, at discounted prices, by selling medications at a fixed markup of 15% plus a $3 flat fee, according to the company’s website. Cost Plus doesn't offer brand-name drugs or accept insurance, so patients pay for medications out of pocket.  The study ""does show that Medicare is overpaying for some of the generic drugs,"" said Dr. Hussain Saleem Lalani, a researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the study’s lead author. ""And this is a conservative estimate, so the actual savings are likely higher.” Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital compared the price of 89 generic drugs sold by Cost Plus Drug in 2022 to the price paid by Medicare Part D plans in 2020. Medicare Part D provides coverage for a wide range of prescription drugs, including for self-administered drugs, such as for those to control high blood pressure or diabetes.  After adjusting for changes in drug costs between 2020 and 2022, the researchers found that Medicare paid more on 77 generic drugs: $8.1 billion compared with $4.5 billion if Medicare had purchased the drugs at the same prices as Cost Plus. Only 12 drugs did not appear to offer any savings. The researchers did not account for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare enrollees, meaning it was unclear how much lower their cost at the pharmacy counter would have been had Medicare purchased the drugs at a lower price.  The findings illustrate the need for policy reform, the authors wrote.  Medicare “could save a lot more money if it had stricter policies on how it paid for drugs,” Lalani said. “There’s a lot more reforms that could be done to optimize the generic drug pricing system, and we should really consider doing those things to lower costs for patients,” he said. Lalani said the study had limitations: Researchers could only compare prices for drugs that were sold by Cost Plus Drug, which represent 25% of the approximately $38 billion in Medicare Part D generic drug spending in 2020.  Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the study certainly raised the question of whether Medicare plans are leaving money on the table, and could be getting better deals on drugs. She was not involved in the research.  Right now, price negotiation is “just a completely black box. There’s not a lot of transparency,” she said.  ""We're kind of putting the burden on the patients to chase down lower prescription drug prices as opposed to kind of finding ways to make them widely accessible,"" she said.  However, making changes that could tackle the problems of generic drug pricing has not been the primary focus of policymakers,  Cubanski said. That’s because the kinds of medications patients usually struggle to pay for are brand-name drugs. Democrats, in particular, have pushed for laws that allow Medicare to directly negotiate prices of the most expensive drugs, which is currently prohibited.  “Saving $3.6 billion is certainly worth pursuing if there’s an opportunity to get that amount of savings,” she said. But most of the dollars from Medicare “are going to higher-priced, brand name and specialty drugs.”  Lalani, who led the study, said it underscores the need for a closer look at our prescription drug pricing system, which includes wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, pharmacies and insurers.

4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/tooth-patrice-lumumba-congo-independence-returned-familly-belgium-rcna33270,"A tooth believed to have been ripped from a man who once carried a nation’s hopes of freedom and democracy is finally going home. The symbolic handover of Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba’s remains is meant to soothe a family’s and a country’s historic pain, but it is also reviving memories of European colonialism and America’s covert war to contain communism.  While the restitution of Lumumba’s tooth Monday may be viewed as a chance for redemption by Belgium amid continuing global outrage over the 2020 killing of George Floyd, some accuse Brussels of exploiting the occasion without making a solid commitment to rectify its historical wrongs. The return of what is widely believed to be Lumumba’s tooth means his family can finally have a “resting place where they can pray for their father,” said Brussels lawyer Christophe Marchand, who represents two of Lumumba’s five children, Francois and Roland. Without the remains, they can’t fully mourn, he said.  Roland Lumumba said Friday at a news conference in Brussels, “I can’t say it’s a feeling of joy, but it’s positive for us that we can bury our loved one.” A Belgian official handed a blue box containing the tooth to members of his family at an official ceremony at Egmont Palace in the Belgian capital on Monday. Following its handover to the family, Lumumba’s tooth will return to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although exact details are unclear, a homecoming tour is expected to take the relic to Lumumba’s home village, ending with an official burial in the capital, Kinshasa. The Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC, gained independence from Belgium in 1960. Lumumba’s election as the independent DRC’s first prime minister shortly beforehand brought hope that the break with colonialism would bring about a real democracy. “We were so hopeful that independence would mean progress, better working and living conditions, more prosperity, using our national resources for the well-being of our people,” said Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja, a professor of African studies at the University of North Carolina.  To many Congolese, Lumumba is a national hero and a “standard bearer of the Congolese independence movement,” said Nzongola-Ntalaja, who has written extensively about Lumumba’s rise from postal clerk and beer salesman to leader of a nation. “We consider Lumumba to be a great chief and a great leader.”  His reputation stretched across the continent, said Reuben Loffman, a lecturer in African history at Queen Mary University of London, who said Lumumba, a charismatic orator, was “somebody who stood up for African sovereignty in desperate circumstances and died for that belief.”  But at the height of the Cold War, Lumumba was also perceived as a Soviet sympathizer, alarming the U.S. and its Western allies.  Ousted by a Western-backed coup three months after he took office, Lumumba was abducted, tortured and assassinated in 1961 at the age of 35. His body was then dug up, dismembered and dissolved in acid by Belgian officers, one of whom said he pocketed a tooth as a “trophy.”  Thus Lumumba’s family and his country were deprived of a burial and a grave.  Lumumba’s assassination remains part of the “national trauma” for the Congolese, Nzongola-Ntalaja said, and it has had far-reaching effects on the nation. The new Congolese democracy unraveled in its wake, shaking the country the size of Western Europe.  In 1997, when the kleptocratic dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was deposed after 32 years in power, the country was left in chaos, with one of the highest debt burdens among developing nations. Today, despite the DRC’s vast mineral wealth, most of its people benefit little from their country’s riches. It’s home to the world’s third-largest population of poor people, according to the World Bank. Although Belgium-backed Congolese separatists executed Lumumba in January 1961, an inquiry by the Belgian Parliament 40 years later established that certain members of the Belgium state at the time were “morally responsible” for the circumstances leading to his death. The prime minister at the time, Guy Verhofstadt, apologized in 2002 for Belgian involvement in Lumumba’s death.  Lumumba’s son Francois launched a separate inquiry into his death in Belgium in 2011, seeking to prosecute 10 Belgians for their connection to his father’s murder. It remains ongoing, with only two of the accused still alive. But some people, including two of Lumumba’s sons, oppose the tooth's restitution.  Guy-Patrice Lumumba said he believes the DRC’s current leadership is exploiting his father’s name to ease relations with Belgium, while the family still awaits justice. “I don’t see how Belgium can take part in this ceremony” he told NBC News. “We have been waiting eleven years. We want the truth. We want justice to be pursued in the assassination of our father.” The Belgian anti-racism activist Mireille-Tsheusi Robert said the restitution was a “marketing operation” that allows Belgium to improve its image without apologizing for its colonial wrongs.  “It is not simply by returning Lumumba’s tooth that we can repair a century of humiliation,” she said. There are also lingering questions about the role the U.S. might have played in his death. The State Department’s historic records reveal that the U.S. government launched a covert political program in Congo in 1960 lasting almost seven years, initially aimed at removing Lumumba from power and replacing him with a more pro-Western leader.  In 1975, a Senate committee investigating CIA plots to assassinate foreign leaders concluded there was a separate, failed plot by the U.S. to poison Lumumba, but it found no evidence that the CIA was connected to his killing.  Nzongola-Ntalaja said the Senate committee conclusion was “disingenuous” for ignoring allegations of U.S. responsibility in destabilizing Lumumba’s political standing. “They concluded the CIA had no responsibility in this matter because they did not open fire on Lumumba,” he said. “They didn’t hold the gun and kill him, but the reality is the CIA played a major role in getting Lumumba removed from government as prime minister.”  The State Department and the CIA wouldn’t comment.  Lumumba’s death capped decades of violent colonial rule and foreign interference in what is now the DRC, so the return of Lumumba’s tooth is of “emblematic significance” for both nations, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said last month.  The country’s monarch, King Philippe, reaffirmed his “deepest regrets” for his nation’s colonial-era abuses in the DRC during a visit to the country this month, but he stopped short of a formal apology. Belgium’s control of the vast region from 1885 to 1960 was marked by savage violence, during which millions of people were turned into a slave labor force, with mutilations commonplace and the nation’s natural resources plundered. But regret isn’t enough, and Belgium should own up to its responsibility for its colonial past as well as Lumumba’s death, Nzongola-Ntalaja said.  In a statement to NBC News ahead of the restitution, the prime minister’s office noted that a parliamentary commission is underway in Belgium that will examine “the dark areas” of its colonial past.“ The DRC has been clear that it is ""not expecting an apology from Belgium,"" De Croo’s official spokesperson said, ""but we now unite our efforts to build the future side by side.” The existence of Lumumba’s tooth came to light in a 1999 interview with Gerard Soete, a former Belgian police commissioner in Congo, who admitted to disinterring and cutting up Lumumba’s corpse before he dissolved it in acid. Soete later told Ludo de Witte, who wrote a book about Lumumba’s assassination, that he had taken the tooth “as a kind of trophy.”  Belgian authorities took possession of the tooth after Soete’s daughter showed it to journalists in 2016.  Whether the tooth is Lumumba’s hasn’t been verified by DNA analysis amid fears that DNA testing could destroy it. Speculation also persists as to whether the tooth comprises Lumumba’s only remains. De Witte said Soete boasted that “he took multiple teeth and part of a finger.” It isn’t known whether his claims are correct or where those remains are.  In 2020, a Belgian court cleared the way for the tooth to be returned to the family, shortly after Lumumba’s daughter, Juliana, wrote a letter to the king asking for the return of her father’s “relics,” calling him “a hero without a grave.” Juliana Lumumba didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Belgian officials have dubbed the tooth’s return “a new pivotal moment in the history of diplomatic relations between Belgium and the DRC, after the visit of King Philippe to the DRC in the second week of June,” De Croo said in a statement said last month. “The remains of Patrice Emery Lumumba refer to the common past between our two countries, including its difficult episodes.” DRC officials haven’t replied to requests for comment about the tooth handover and its significance to the nation.
